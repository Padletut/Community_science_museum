## Project Planning and Management

A pivotal aspect of this project was its meticulous planning and effective management. To support this, Trello was used as an online project management tool. Trello's card-based system allowed for organized task management, tracking progress, and efficient responsibility management.

The adaptability of Trello proved beneficial, as project details evolved over time. Live updates and adjustments in Trello streamlined the project management process, eliminating the need for continuous manual updates.

Additionally, a GitHub repository was created for version control, and the website was deployed on Netlify, ensuring seamless deployment and online accessibility.
